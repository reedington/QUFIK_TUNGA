## DeepSeeker: An Open-Source Model

DeepSeeker is an open-source model implemented in the `Article Generation for Developers` notebook. However, the implementation demonstrated a sluggish performance. To overcome this limitation, we incorporated OpenAI GPT-4 into the system, enhancing the model's speed and responsiveness. The model is still available to be run in the `Article Generation for Developers` notebook. Using a GPU would incur a wait time of about 5-10 minutes. Using a CPU would incur a wait time of about 10 minutes.

### OpenAI GPT-4 Integration

To address the speed constraints, we integrated OpenAI GPT-4 to achieve wait times of 3 minutes or less. This not only accelerates the application's processing but also leverages the advanced capabilities of GPT-4, providing improved efficiency and more accurate outcomes.
